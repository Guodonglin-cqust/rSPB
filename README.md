# rSPB
Restructure single parabolic band(**SPB**) model for quick analysis in thermoelectricity

'SPB Calculation And Plot.xltx' is an efficient tool to implement SPB analysis. The Seebeck coefficient, 
carrier consideration and mobility are required as inputs. Effective mass, intrinsic carrier mobility, 
weighted carrier mobility, optimal carrier concentration and corresponding maximum power factor can be 
evaluated under SPB framework.


***Key words:***  thermoelectric, single parabolic band(SPB) model, Boltzmann transport equation(BTE)
